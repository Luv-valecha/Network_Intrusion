## 🚀 **Usage**

Follow these steps to set up and run the **Network Intrusion Detection System**:

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Extract Data Files:  
     On Windows, execute the following command in the Command Prompt to extract the dataset:  
     ```bash
     Expand-Archive -Path ".\API\data\raw\archive.zip" -DestinationPath ".\API\data\raw"
     ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**:  
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for analysis:  
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:  
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

4. **Launch the Frontend Application**:
